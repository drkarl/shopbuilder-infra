# Common Outputs Reference
# ========================
# This file serves as DOCUMENTATION ONLY - it is not used by Terraform.
# Each environment (dev, staging, prod) should define these outputs
# in environments/<env>/outputs.tf to maintain consistency.

# output "environment" {
#   description = "Current environment name"
#   value       = local.environment
# }
#
# output "project_name" {
#   description = "Project name"
#   value       = var.project_name
# }
